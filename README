---Description

pyTivo lets you stream most videos from your PC to your unhacked tivo. 
It uses the HMO server protocol. It will guess if your video is 4:3 or 
16:9 and pad your video if it thinks it is needed. It will not transcode 
an mpeg that is supported by your tivo.

---Requirements

OS = Anything that will run Python 3 and ffmpeg. Known to work on Linux, 
Mac OS X and Windows.

Python 3 - https://www.python.org/download/
- You need Python 3.x (tested with Python 3.13.9)
- This version has been converted from Python 2 to Python 3

pywin32 (only to install as a service) - 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018&package_id=79063
- Windows users only and only if you intend to install as a service

---Usage

You need to edit pyTivo.conf in 3 places

1. ffmpeg=
2. [<name of share>]
3. path=

ffmpeg should be the full path to ffmpeg including filename. If the specified 
path is not found, pyTivo will automatically search for ffmpeg in your system 
PATH. path is the absolute path to your media.
